The first time it happened, I was understandably worried and went to the emergency room. After some X-rays and an hour on an EKG, they sent me home saying they couldn\\'t find evidence of anything wrong. Since then, it\\'s happened several more times, occasionally accompanied by a feeling of shortness of breath. Whenever it happens, I check my pulse and nothing seems wrong (occasionally the pulse line looks a bit odd on my phone, but that could easily be an issue caused by my hand moving or something) and I never actually have any trouble drawing in breath.  Over the last few days, this has been recurring periodically, along with an occasional feeling of tightness in my throat and one or two bouts of transient weakness.\\n\\nAs background, I had two spontaneous pneumothoraxes in my left lung a little over a decade ago, the second of which was treated with a chest tube and eventually a pluerodesis. I think I had some minor nerve damage as a result of the surgery; at the very least, the entire left side of my chest was left numb for several months. Other than that and a broken right clavicle, I\\'ve never had any major health issues. I don\\'t smoke, use drugs, or drink, and while I\\'m a little overweight (6\\'0\", ~190 lbs, male), I try to at get at least a little light cardio exercise on a daily basis. I\\'m 28.\\n\\nSo...

Often a resting EKG is normal in people with heart disease. You should also have a chest X-ray and even a CT scan of your chest. With your history of pneumothoraces I would go for a scan because you could have pleuritic pain and the inflammation is difficult to see on a normal chest X-ray. A pleurodesis could cause chronic inflammation and irritation in the area that leads to discomfort. Be aware that the are many causes for chest pain and the best person to see is a good internist who will examine you, send you for many tests and hopefully arrange a stress EKG and scan of your chest.\"], 'score': [3]}, 'title_urls': [], 'selftext_urls': [], 'answers_urls': []}\n"

Benign (non-cancerous) possibilities include fibroadenomas, which are solid, rubbery lumps, cysts, which are fluid-filled sacs, or dense areas of tissue related to fibrocystic changes. However, a new, hard, or persistent lump can also be a sign of breast cancer. Because it is impossible to determine the cause without a physical examination and likely imaging tests like a mammogram or ultrasound, you should schedule an appointment with your doctor or a gynecologist as soon as possible. Prompt medical evaluation is the only way to get an accurate diagnosis, relieve your anxiety, and ensure you receive any necessary treatment.\n"

Yesterday my husband was at work (he works at a monument company and cuts stone) and about 2000 pounds of limestone landed on his left forearm (He moved just in time so it didn't hit and crush his head).  Miraculously it didn't get broken (xrays were taken at hospital) but he has a nasty gash that's an open wound.  The hospital didn't tell him how to clean the area and I can visibly see blood seeping through the gauze and ace bandage as he's sleeping.  We have to go out to get stuff for his arm (gauze and things) and I don't know what else we should get?  They also prescribed him antibiotics, but how do I know if it's infected?    \\nAny help would be greatly appreciated... Oh and what's a good OTC pain killer? He needs something that's decently strong so his arm isn't throbbing while he sleeps.

When used appropriately for a short-term injury, chance of addiction is quite low. Even more so because he's concerned about it. Addiction typically develops from long-term use.\\n\\nOver-the-counter choices would be either naproxen (Aleve) OR ibuprofen (Motrin), but not both in the same day as they are the same class; take with food to reduce chances of developing an ulcer.
